Algorithm for 2D Rotation of an object.
Consider a point object O has to be rotated from one angle to another in a 2D plane.
 
Let-
•	Initial coordinates of the object O = (Xold, Yold)
•	Initial angle of the object O with respect to origin = Φ
•	Rotation angle = θ
•	New coordinates of the object O after rotation = (Xnew, Ynew)

This rotation is achieved by using the following rotation equations-
•	Xnew = Xold x cosθ – Yold x sinθ
•	Ynew = Xold x sinθ + Yold x cosθ
